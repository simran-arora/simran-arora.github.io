Magnetism has been studied as a means to perform such fine scale manipulation, but generating fields that discriminate between targets at small length scales is nontrivial. We present a system for simultaneous control of multiple magnetic microrobots with characteristic lengths on the order of 10 μνα, which is based on the superposition of magnetic fields generated at centimeter scale (global) as well as micrometer scale (local)."

	"Description": "This work focuses on the physics of the HTPB polymer, which is widely used in United States Naval explosives and rocket motor formulations. These composites are often subjected to extreme temperatures, shocks, and pressures in the field, which has led to disasterous unintended detonations. Methods to better understand the behavior of these composites are highly desirable - this work presents a method for analyzing temperature localization in these composites with submicron spatial resolution."
