Magnetism has been studied as a means to perform such fine scale manipulation, but generating fields that discriminate between targets at small length scales is nontrivial. We present a system for simultaneous control of multiple magnetic microrobots with characteristic lengths on the order of 10 ŒºŒΩŒ±, which is based on the superposition of magnetic fields generated at centimeter scale (global) as well as micrometer scale (local)."

These composites are often subjected to extreme temperatures, shocks, and pressures in the field, which has led to disasterous unintended detonations. Methods to better understand the behavior of these composites are highly desirable - this work presents a method for analyzing temperature localization in these composites with submicron spatial resolution."
